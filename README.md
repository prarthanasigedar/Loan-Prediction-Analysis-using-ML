# Loan-Prediction-Analysis-using-ML
The project aims to revolutionize and optimize the student loan approval process in the Indian banking sector through machine learning. By leveraging predictive models, the project seeks to objectively assess loan applications based on applicant characteristics, addressing inefficiencies, delays, and subjective decision-making.

# About Dataset

The loan approval dataset is a collection of financial records and associated information used to determine the eligibility of individuals or organizations for obtaining loans from a lending institution. It includes various factors such as cibil score, income, employment status, loan term, loan amount, assets value, and loan status. This dataset is commonly used in machine learning and data analysis to develop models and algorithms that predict the likelihood of loan approval based on the given features.

# üöÄ Abstract

This project aims to address the inefficiencies in the student loan approval process within the Indian banking sector by harnessing machine learning techniques. The primary objective is to create predictive models capable of assessing loan applications based on applicant characteristics, thereby increasing efficiency, objectivity, and the speed of loan decisions.The process begins with data preparation, where the dataset is loaded, preprocessed,performed some visualization and statistical tests and then split into training and testing sets. Extensive data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis have been performed to understand the relationships between various features and loan approval outcomes. I have used different ML models, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, Gradient Boost and Decision Trees. RFE estimator was used to select top 4 features for model development. After hyper tuning, Gradient Boost showed the most promising results with a training and testing accuracy of 98.13% and 97.4% respectively. The motivation stems from the inefficiencies in the current manual approach, and the project holds personal significance, grounded in a familial connection to the banking sector. Ultimately, the goal is to not only improve the loan approval process but also positively impact individuals seeking educational financing.

### Data Preparation

...

### üìä Data Visualization

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) involved a comprehensive set of visualizations to understand the distribution, relationships, and patterns within the dataset. The following visualizations highlight key aspects of the data:

#####  Distribution of Applicant Features:

Utilized histograms to visualize the distribution of key applicant features, including credit score, annual income, loan amount, and loan term.
Identified the central tendencies and spread of each feature to gain insights into the dataset's characteristics.

##### Correlation Heatmap:

Generated a heatmap to visualize the correlation matrix of numerical features.
Identified strong correlations between certain features, providing insights into potential multicollinearity.

### Model Development


#### Performance Evaluation

To assess the performance of the developed predictive models, various metrics were employed, providing a nuanced understanding of their effectiveness in automating and enhancing the loan approval process. The following metrics were chosen for their relevance in the context of loan approval scenarios:

F1 Score: The F1 score represents the harmonic mean of precision and recall, offering a balanced measure of a model's ability to make accurate positive predictions while correctly identifying actual positive cases. In scenarios like loan approval, where both precision and recall are crucial, the F1 score provides a comprehensive evaluation.

Accuracy: Accuracy is a measure of the overall correctness of the model's predictions. High accuracy indicates that the model generally makes correct loan approval predictions.

Precision: Precision is the ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the total predicted positives. In the context of loan approval, it indicates how often the model correctly predicted "Approved" when it made a positive prediction.

Recall: Recall is the ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the all observations in actual class. In the context of loan approval, it indicates how well the model identifies loan applications that should be approved.

| Model                   | F1 Score | Accuracy | Precision | Recall   |
|-------------------------|----------|----------|-----------|----------|
| Logistic Regression     | 91%      | 91.5%    | 88.42%    | 86.48%   |
| Decision Trees          | 97.13%   | 97.47%   | 95.7%     | 95.5%    |
| Random Forest Classifier| 97.29%   | 97.18%   | 97.48%    | 96.58%   |
| Gradient Boost          | 98.18%   | 97.89%   | 98.125%   | 96.3%    |


#### HyperParameter Tuning
Hyperparameter tuning is a crucial step in optimizing the performance of machine learning models. It involves systematically searching the hyperparameter space to find the set of hyperparameters that result in the best model performance. The following details outline the hyperparameter tuning process for each algorithm:

| **Model**               | **Before Tuning F1 Score** | **After Tuning F1 Score** | **Improvement** | **Hyperparameter Details**                                   |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Logistic Regression     | 88%                         | 91%                        | 3%               | C = 0.1, Solver = 'lbfgs', Max Iterations = 100             |
| Decision Trees          | 97.13%                      | 97.62%                     | 0.50%            | Max Depth = 10, Min Samples Split = 2, Min Samples Leaf = 1 |
| Random Forest Classifier| 97.29%                      | 97.40%                     | 0.11%            | N Estimators = 100, Max Depth = 12, Min Samples Split = 2   |
| Gradient Boost          | 97.40%                      | 98.18%                     | 0.94%            | Learning Rate = 0.1, N Estimators = 200, Max Depth = 5     |

#### Confusion Metrix
A confusion matrix is a valuable tool for understanding the performance of a classification model. It breaks down the model's predictions into four categories: true positive (TP), true negative (TN), false positive (FP), and false negative (FN).

|                  | Predicted: No Approval | Predicted: Approval |
|------------------|------------------------|----------------------|
| Actual: No Approval | 261                   | 5                   |
| Actual: Approval    | 3                   | 158                   |


True Positive (TP): The model correctly identified 158 approved loan applications.
True Negative (TN): The model correctly identified 261 denied loan applications.
False Positive (FP): The model incorrectly predicted that 5 loan applications would be approved, but they were actually denied.
False Negative (FN): The model incorrectly predicted that 3 loan applications would be denied, but they were actually approved.

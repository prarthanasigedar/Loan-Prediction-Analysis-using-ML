# Loan-Prediction-Analysis-using-ML
The aim of this project was to develop a predictive model for loan approval based on applicant characteristics. The focus is on determining the probability of loan approval using a broad set of features such as income, credit history, and employment status.

# About Dataset

The loan approval dataset is a collection of financial records and associated information used to determine the eligibility of individuals or organizations for obtaining loans from a lending institution. It includes various factors such as cibil score, income, employment status, loan term, loan amount, assets value, and loan status. This dataset is commonly used in machine learning and data analysis to develop models and algorithms that predict the likelihood of loan approval based on the given features.

We can also find the dataset over kaggle.com: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/architsharma01/loan-approval-prediction-dataset?sort=published

# Predictive Model for Loan Approval Outcomes

## Overview

The project aims to revolutionize and optimize the student loan approval process in the Indian banking sector through machine learning. By leveraging predictive models, the project seeks to objectively assess loan applications based on applicant characteristics, addressing inefficiencies, delays, and subjective decision-making.

#### Model Evaluation Metrics

To assess the performance of the developed predictive models, various metrics were employed, providing a nuanced understanding of their effectiveness in automating and enhancing the loan approval process. The following metrics were chosen for their relevance in the context of loan approval scenarios:

    F1 Score: The F1 score represents the harmonic mean of precision and recall, offering a balanced measure of a model's ability to make accurate positive predictions while correctly identifying actual positive cases. In scenarios like loan approval, where both precision and recall are crucial, the F1 score provides a comprehensive evaluation.

    Accuracy: Accuracy is a measure of the overall correctness of the model's predictions. High accuracy indicates that the model generally makes correct loan approval predictions.

    Precision: Precision is the ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the total predicted positives. In the context of loan approval, it indicates how often the model correctly predicted "Approved" when it made a positive prediction.

Recall: Recall is the ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the all observations in actual class. In the context of loan approval, it indicates how well the model identifies loan applications that should be approved.

| Model                   | F1 Score | Accuracy | Precision | Recall   |
|-------------------------|----------|----------|-----------|----------|
| Logistic Regression     | 91%      | 91.5%    | 88.42%    | 86.48%   |
| Decision Trees          | 97.13%   | 97.47%   | 95.7%     | 95.5%    |
| Random Forest Classifier| 97.29%   | 97.18%   | 97.48%    | 96.58%   |
| Gradient Boost          | 98.18%   | 97.89%   | 98.125%   | 96.3%    |

## üåü Conclusion

The project successfully addresses inefficiencies in the student loan approval process through machine learning. The Gradient Boost model emerged as the top-performing model, achieving training and testing accuracies of 97.40% and 98.18%, respectively. The project holds significance not only in improving the loan approval process but also in positively impacting individuals seeking educational financing.

# Loan-Prediction-Analysis-using-ML
The aim of this project was to develop a predictive model for loan approval based on applicant characteristics. The focus is on determining the probability of loan approval using a broad set of features such as income, credit history, and employment status.

# About Dataset

The loan approval dataset is a collection of financial records and associated information used to determine the eligibility of individuals or organizations for obtaining loans from a lending institution. It includes various factors such as cibil score, income, employment status, loan term, loan amount, assets value, and loan status. This dataset is commonly used in machine learning and data analysis to develop models and algorithms that predict the likelihood of loan approval based on the given features.

# Loan-Prediction-Analysis-using-ML
The aim of this project was to develop a predictive model for loan approval based on applicant characteristics. The focus is on determining the probability of loan approval using a broad set of features such as income, credit history, and employment status.

# About Dataset

The loan approval dataset is a collection of financial records and associated information used to determine the eligibility of individuals or organizations for obtaining loans from a lending institution. It includes various factors such as cibil score, income, employment status, loan term, loan amount, assets value, and loan status. This dataset is commonly used in machine learning and data analysis to develop models and algorithms that predict the likelihood of loan approval based on the given features.

We can also find the dataset over kaggle.com: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/architsharma01/loan-approval-prediction-dataset?sort=published

# Predictive Model for Loan Approval Outcomes

## Overview

The project aims to revolutionize and optimize the student loan approval process in the Indian banking sector through machine learning. By leveraging predictive models, the project seeks to objectively assess loan applications based on applicant characteristics, addressing inefficiencies, delays, and subjective decision-making.

## üåü Conclusion

The project successfully addresses inefficiencies in the student loan approval process through machine learning. The Gradient Boost model emerged as the top-performing model, achieving training and testing accuracies of 97.40% and 98.18%, respectively. The project holds significance not only in improving the loan approval process but also in positively impacting individuals seeking educational financing.
